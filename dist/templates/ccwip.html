        <a href="http://cssr.berkeley.edu/ucb_childwelfare/">CCWIP’s website</a> is the primary delivery mechanism for these reports, but ten years of continuous development had left the site bloated, with reports frustratingly difficult to find.

          Building Empathy for Childwelfare Workers

        <p class="paragraph-light">
          Our design process began by developing an intuition for how these workers do their job. Understanding who they are and what they are trying to do is a critical first step towards designing an intuitive solution. Two information sessions were conducted with CCWIP staff, as well as background research on California’s child welfare system.

          To understand the role of data in child welfare, a matrix of use cases was developed that outlined not only the various user groups, but their data-relevant characteristics, as well.

        <p class="paragraph-light">
          In addition to user research, an exploration of the existing CCWIP site was undertaken, including a complete content audit. This helped the team develop an intuition for the kind of content CCWIP produces, and to begin to understand where gaps currently exist, and why those gaps are problematic.

          Collaborating with CCWIP staff, two personas were developed to represent two of the keys users of the CCWIP website: County Analyst John and Reporter Amanda.

The second use case involved John using the CCWIP website to evaluate the county's SIP plan. This is a much less intensive, higher-level use of the site and was ultimately chosen as the use case to design for.</p>

The site already had a personalized dashboard feature of most populare reports that was also incorporated.

          Aside from content reorganization and branding, a number of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">usability improvements</a> were introduced, including: a breadcrumb system to better orient the user, a navigation bar and footer that differentiate non-essential links from navigational elements, and standardized UI components that create platform conventions.

          The final facilitates the analysts quest to find the data they are looking for by catering to both beginner and advanced users. Centering the design around lateral movement between reports keeps data exploration at the center of the experience, and deplopyment of usability concepts throughout ensures that the site is intuitive and consistent.

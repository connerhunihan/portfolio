        ADP is Autodesk’s next generation big data platform. By combining datasets from across the company into a single warehouse, ADP offers unparalleled insight into customer behavior.

      <p class="paragraph-light">
        ADP was built on foundations from many earlier iterations. By 2018, the complexity of these foundations was beginning to impact the user’s experience to the point where creating a simple data pipeline required intense, custom guidance.

      <p class="paragraph-light">
        Embedded within the Data Platform Strategy and Engagement team (DPSE), my role over the summer of 2018 was to research, conceptualize, and design a system to improve the user experience of ADP.

          Empathizing with the Difficulties of Big Data
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-light">
          To develop intuition around the knowledge challenges facing ADP, user research was conducted including over 20 interviews, two workshops, a community survey, and countless whiteboard diagraming.

          Distinct user groups
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-light">
          The community survey revealed distinct user groups within ADP, each of which had their own data needs, technological proficiencies, and preference for learning.

          Identifying Resource Gaps

        <p class="paragraph-light">
          An audit of the existing ADP knowledge bases was conducted to target most troublesome areas. While knowledge gaps were discovered throughout the entire ADP process, it was the uncertainty at the beginning stages of engagement – when a business team investigates capabilities of the data platform – that offered the most potential. A team cannot use the platform if they don’t know what it can do.

          Interviews with data engineers, data analysts, product owners, and team leads suggested that knowledge needs varied significantly across teams.

          Lessons Learned from Big Data Design
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-light">
          Working on the Autodesk Data Platform was a unique and invaluable experience in many ways. I learned much that, were I to run the same project again, I would do differently.

          Personal Strength: Synthesizing
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-light">
          The project was interdisciplinary from the very beginning, crossing boundaries between user experience design, research, data science and business, and I realized a personal strength in synthesizing and communicating across those team and boundaries.

          Personal Passion: Consulting + Service Design
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-light">
          I discovered a tremendous passion, not only for service design, but for working in the capacity of a consultant.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-light">
          As a platform that facilitates team-based big data explorations, designing for ADP required more than a list of needs and a few personas. It required an understanding of the working relationship teams have, and of how data helps facilitate that relationship. I discovered a passion for mapping processes, measuring across dimensions. and prioritizing efforts.

          Professional Realization: Process, process, process
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-light">
          An ambitous project on a tight deadline required clear direction at all times. School and previous projects had exposed me to pieces of an overall process, but the ADP project helped me realize how a comprehensive process enables true innovation.

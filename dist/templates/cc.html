        License Chooser Tool Redesign
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-light">
        The Creative Commons (CC) is a non-profit organization that has developed several copyright-licenses that help content creators share and protect their work by licensing it free of charge to the public. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-light">
        In January 2018, CC kicked off the <a href="https://medium.com/@janepk/findings-from-the-discovery-phase-of-cc-usability-3bde89d55a74">CC Usability Initiative</a> to rennovate the experience of CC licensing. Nine core insights were discovered and six projects green-lit for prototyping.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-light">
       Redesigning the License Chooser Tool was one of those six projects, and CC partnered with INFO290: Product Studio Design to develop the concept and deliver a prototype.

          Research Synthesis

        <p class="paragraph-light">
          CC staff conducted a total of 117 interviews with publications and users of all kinds. This resulted in nine keyinsights, two of which were relevant to the License Chooser Tool:

        <p class="header-3">
          Licenses are not understood
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-light">
          While creators understand that CC stands for free content sharing, the specifics of licensing were not clearly understood.
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote">
          "I've been using CC for years and I couldn't explain the differences between the license options to you."

          The Licensing Process is not understood
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-light">
          While creators are motivated to license their work under CC, they have a hard time figuring out how to do so. While usability of the existing License Chooser Tool undoubtedly caused some of this uncertainty, interviews suggested that creators simply did not fully understand the process. In particular, how licenses are generated on the CC website, but often nbeeding to be applied on third-party platforms at the moment the creator uploads their content.
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote">
          "An event producer and artist says he's always meant to CC license some of his work, but has never gotten around to it. "Maybe if it was more easier, like swipe up to license...""

          This has lead to a lack of standardization across platforms, as well as feeling of loss of control by users.

        <p class="paragraph-light">
          Working with the Director of Product & Research, a final design objective was framed: give users a tool, not only to find the license they need, but to learn about the licensing process along the way. This tool also needed to be portable across platforms, in order to offer third-party content hosting platforms a standardized template.
        </p>

          How might we educate users about the process of using the license they are selecting for their work?

          A user persona was created in the shadow of a typical user. Paulo is a University professor who publishes a variety of content types (academic papers, datasets, conference presentations), and he publishes that content across a variety of platforms, using many tools. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-light">
          For Paulo, content is his life’s work, and so it is important not only to share it publically, but to protect it, as well. Paulo believes that the open sharing of knowledge is fundamental to his work. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-light">
          For Paulo, the act of sharing is a statement.

          These foundations were used to develop a new metaphor for the design – making a recipe.

           <b>1. Shopping List</b><br>
           Create a list of the "ingredients" to be used. This is provided by titrating the explanation of the license components into increasingly detailed levels of exploration.

          <p class="paragraph-light">
           <b>2. Shopping Cart</b><br>
            Explore the store, pick items up, put items down. We encourage such exploration through an interactive matrix that allows for attribute-based comparison.

          <p class="paragraph-light">
           <b>3. Recipe</b><br>
            Follow the recipe to turn those ingredients into a meal. In licensing terminology, this means instructing people on the process of how to actually apply the license they have just selected.

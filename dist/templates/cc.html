        <p class="paragraph-light">
          The Creative Commons (CC) is a non-profit dedicated to expanding the range of creative works available for others to build upon levally and to share. The organization has developed several copyright-licenses known as Creative Commons licenses that help content creators protect their work by licensing it free of charge to the public. 
        </p>
        <p class="header-3">
          The CC USability Initiative
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-light">
          In January 2018, CC kicked off the CC Usability Initiative to update the experience of CC licensing and discovery to reflect the realities of digital sharing in 2018, and to antiripate and design for the future of digital content sharing. After six months of user research, CC revealed nine core insights and green lit six project concepts for prototyping. The Creative Commons partnered with individual students from INFO290: Product Studio Design to realize three of those concepts, collaborating directly with the Director of Product & Research, Jane Park.

          Key Insights

        <p class="header-3">
          Licenses are not understood
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-light">
          The research phase of <em>CC Usability</em> yielded two significant challenges in the process of finding and applying a license. The first was the realization that while people understand that CC stands for free content sharing, the specifics of licensing were not clearly understood.
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote">
          "I've been using CC for years and I couldn't explain the differences between the license options to you."
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote-attribution">

        </p>
        <p class="header-3">
          The Licensing Process is not understood
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-light">
          A second insight that came out of the CC Usability findings was that while people are motivated to license their work under CC, they have a hard time figuring out how to do so. While some of this uncertainty could be addressed through a redesign of the License Chooser Tool on the CC website, the issue of figuring out how to apply a license most frequently presents itself on third-party platforms at the moment when users first upload content.
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote">
          "An event producer and artist says he's always meant to CC license some of his work, but has never gotten around to it. "Maybe if it was more easier, like swipe up to license...""
        </p>

        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-light">
          Further, licenses need to be attached to the work they are being applied to, and since digital work is hosted on third-party platforms (YouTube, Flikr, Medium), the introduction of users to CC licensing is often left to those third-party platforms to design. 
          <br>
          <br>
          This has lead to a lack of standardization across platforms, as well as feeling of loss of control by users.

          Constraints
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-light">
          Working directly with CC staff, the constraints for the project was finalized. CC users needed a way to not only find the license they needed, but to learn about the selection process along the way. The design of such a selector tool also needed to be portable across platforms, in order to offer third-party content hosting platforms a standardized template.
        </p>

          How might the design of the license chooser tool empower users to better understand the process and intricacies of the license they are selecting?

          Target User
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-light">
          A single user persona – Paulo – was developed to ground the project. Paulo is a typical user; he is a University professor who wrote a paper that was recently cited by a publishing group, The Converation. As part of his research, Paulo produces many types of content, uses many tools, and stores his content on multiple platforms. For Paulo, his content is his life’s work, and so it is important not only to be able to share it, but to protect it. 
          <br>
          For Paulo, act of sharing is a statement.

          The final deliverable for the project would be a high-fidelity prototype of a License Selector feature to replace the existing selector tool on the CC website. The design was to address selection on both mobile and desktop devices, and also needed to integrate with a third-party platform.

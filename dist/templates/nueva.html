        Nueva is a private school based in Hillsborough, California. In 2014, the school opened a second, upper school campus, thereby almost doubling in size.

      <p class="paragraph-light">
        The influx of new community members strained Nueva’s digital platforms: the sheer volume of communication was a new frontier and institutional values had never been so vital to document and share.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-light">
        Working with the Communications Department, a storytelling platform was created to unburden communications logistics and celebrate Nueva’s evolving identity.

        <p class="paragraph-light">
          The key metrics that the Communications monitored after the storytelling platform launched in the fall of 2016 was whether open rates and/or click through rates would change. Given a new format and change in schedule, we expected a sudden, sharp decline in readership. Three months into the school year, however, the numbers were clear:
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote">
          Open rates for the entire community held steady at 62%

        <p class="blockquote-attribution"></p>
        <p class="paragraph-light">
          Many of these students were new to the school, and so the team was thrilled to see the cultural values and norms that we were documenting being read by exactly the audience we intended.

        <p class="paragraph-light">
          However, while the site may have had an overhaul, the basic structure of the site had not changed. The front page is still used as a publishing platform, and the categorization of content is nearly identical.
